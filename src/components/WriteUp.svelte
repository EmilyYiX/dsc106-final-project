    <h1>Writeup</h1>
    <h2>What have we done so far?</h2>
    <p>So far we have set up the project on GitHub and created a basic line plot. We have cleaned the dataset according to the 
      functionality that we want to implement. As part of cleaning we have dealt with missing values and column labels. We have also 
      implemented a search box to search for a country and see its temperature change over the years. That was one interactive element 
      we have implemented. Another interactive element that we have implemented is the tooltip information for the lines on the plot. It 
      shows the country and the temperature change of the nearest country's line.
    </p>
    <h2>What was the most challenging part to design?</h2>
    <p> The most challenging aspect of the project to design is likely to be  handle missing values, specifically the logic of 
    back-filling these gaps with the most recent year's temperature change data. This process is  significant for maintaining the 
    integrity of the dataset and ensuring the smoothness of temperature change over time. Additionally, the integration of a search 
    box that interacts seamlessly with the visualization also took us a lot of effort to debug to achieve the effect that the system 
    can respond dynamically to user queries without lags and errors. Besides that,  we are using 'multiselect' library to assist us 
    on displaying an editable list of countries, complete with a functionality to add or remove entries in our visualization.
